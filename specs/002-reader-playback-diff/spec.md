# Feature Specification: Reader View, Timeline Playback, and Diff Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `002-reader-playback-diff`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement reader view, timeline playback, and diff viewer for the writing timeline platform. This includes US5 (public document reading), US6+US7 (playback with speed controls), and US8 (first draft vs final comparison)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Public Document Reading (US5) (Priority: P1)

Readers can access and view published documents from writers without requiring an account or authentication. This provides the core value proposition of making writing timelines publicly accessible.

**Why this priority**: Essential foundation for the platform - enables public access to content, which is the primary way the platform delivers value to end users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sharing a document URL with someone who has no account, and they should be able to read the complete document content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a published document exists, **When** a user visits the public document URL, **Then** they can read the full document content without login
2. **Given** a user is reading a public document, **When** they scroll through the content, **Then** the reading experience is smooth and intuitive
3. **Given** a document is not published or set to private, **When** a user tries to access it, **Then** they see an appropriate message indicating the document is not available

### User Story 2 - Timeline Playback with Speed Controls (US6+US7) (Priority: P2)

Users can watch the writing process unfold over time by playing back the document's edit history with configurable playback speed controls.

**Why this priority**: Core differentiating feature that shows the writing timeline - delivers unique value that distinguishes this platform from standard document viewers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a document with multiple edits, then using playback controls to watch the writing process at different speeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a document with edit history, **When** a user clicks the playback button, **Then** they see the document evolve chronologically through each edit
2. **Given** playback is active, **When** a user adjusts the speed control, **Then** the playback speed changes immediately (e.g., 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)
3. **Given** playback is running, **When** a user clicks pause, **Then** playback stops at the current timeline position
4. **Given** playback is paused, **When** a user clicks on a specific point in the timeline, **Then** the document jumps to show content at that moment in time
5. **Given** playback reaches the end of the timeline, **When** the final edit is shown, **Then** playback automatically stops and shows completion state

### User Story 3 - First Draft vs Final Comparison (US8) (Priority: P3)

Users can compare the original first draft with the final version to see the overall transformation of the document through a side-by-side or overlay diff view.

**Why this priority**: Valuable analytical feature that provides insight into the writing evolution, but not essential for basic platform functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a document, making multiple edits, then using the diff viewer to compare first and final versions with clear highlighting of changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a document with multiple revisions, **When** a user selects "Compare First vs Final", **Then** they see a side-by-side view showing original and final versions
2. **Given** the diff view is displayed, **When** viewing the comparison, **Then** additions are highlighted in green and deletions are highlighted in red
3. **Given** the diff view is active, **When** a user clicks on a specific change, **Then** the system highlights the corresponding section in both versions
4. **Given** a document has substantial changes, **When** viewing the diff, **Then** users can navigate between changes using next/previous controls

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a document has no edit history (only one version)?
- How does the system handle documents with thousands of edits during playback performance?
- What happens when timeline data is corrupted or missing for certain time periods?
- How does diff comparison work when the document structure changes dramatically (e.g., complete rewrites)?
- What happens when a user tries to access playback features on a document that doesn't support timeline features?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow anonymous users to view published documents without authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST display document content in a clean, readable format optimized for consumption
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide timeline playback controls including play, pause, and speed adjustment
- **FR-004**: System MUST support playback speeds of 0.5x, 1x, 2x, and 4x normal speed
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to scrub through the timeline to jump to specific points in time
- **FR-006**: System MUST render document state accurately at any point in the edit timeline
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual diff comparison between first draft and final version
- **FR-008**: System MUST highlight additions and deletions in the diff view with distinct colors
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle documents with minimal edit history gracefully (single version documents)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide navigation controls in diff view to jump between changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain reading performance even for documents with extensive edit histories
- **FR-012**: System MUST show appropriate loading states during timeline reconstruction and diff generation

### Key Entities

- **Document**: Represents a published piece of writing with its complete edit history and metadata
- **Timeline Event**: Individual edit or change in the document history with timestamp and content state
- **Diff Change**: Specific addition, deletion, or modification between two document versions
- **Playback State**: Current position and speed settings for timeline playback functionality

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access and read any published document within 2 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Timeline playback renders document changes smoothly with less than 100ms delay between edit states
- **SC-003**: Diff comparison loads and displays for documents up to 10,000 words within 3 seconds
- **SC-004**: 95% of users can successfully use playback controls without instruction or help documentation
- **SC-005**: System supports concurrent viewing by 1,000+ users without performance degradation
- **SC-006**: Users can navigate through document timelines containing up to 500 edit events without performance issues

## Assumptions

- Documents have structured edit history data available for timeline reconstruction
- Timeline events include sufficient metadata for accurate chronological playback
- Document content is stored in a format that enables efficient diff calculation
- Published documents are optimized for public viewing (not requiring specialized editing tools)
- Users accessing reader view have standard web browsers with modern JavaScript support
- Document authors have explicitly published their content for public viewing
